TLS (Transport Layer Security) is a cryptographic protocol used to provide secure communication over a network, typically the internet. It works by providing authentication, encryption, and data integrity.

Here's a high-level overview of how TLS works:

Handshake phase: The client and server exchange information to establish a secure connection. This includes agreeing on a protocol version, exchanging cryptographic keys, and verifying the identity of the server (via digital certificates).

Key exchange phase: The client and server use the previously exchanged keys to establish a shared secret key. This key will be used to encrypt and decrypt data exchanged between the client and server.

Data transfer phase: The client and server can now exchange data securely. All data is encrypted and decrypted using the shared secret key.

Termination phase: Once the communication is complete, the connection is terminated.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of each phase:

Handshake phase:

a. Client initiates a connection to the server and requests a secure connection.

b. Server responds with its digital certificate, which includes its public key.

c. The client verifies the certificate's authenticity and extracts the server's public key.

d. The client generates a pre-master secret key and encrypts it with the server's public key. This encrypted message is sent to the server.

e. The server decrypts the pre-master secret key with its private key.

f. The client and server use the pre-master secret key to generate a master secret key.

g. Both the client and server use the master secret key to generate session keys, which are used to encrypt and decrypt data during the session.

Key exchange phase:

a. Both the client and server use the agreed-upon protocol version to encrypt and decrypt data using the session keys.

Data transfer phase:

a. The client and server exchange data securely, with all data encrypted and decrypted using the session keys.

Termination phase:

a. Either the client or server can initiate the connection termination.

b. Both the client and server agree on the termination.

c. The connection is closed.

TLS can use different encryption algorithms and key exchange methods, depending on the protocol version and the security level required. The most common encryption algorithm used is AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), and the most common key exchange method is RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman).

- So anyone can get the master secret or the session keys for browser?

No, the master secret and session keys are generated using a process called the "key exchange" in TLS, which is designed to ensure that only the client and the server involved in the communication have access to these secret keys. The key exchange process typically involves some form of asymmetric encryption (such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman) to securely exchange a shared secret, which is then used to derive the master secret and session keys. Additionally, TLS provides encryption and authentication mechanisms to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the exchanged data, making it difficult for an attacker to intercept or tamper with the traffic and obtain the secret keys.

- But if browser sends the encrypted messages using the secret session key which is derived from the master key, it means browser has to store it somewhere to decrypt the following messages?

Yes, that's correct. The browser will temporarily store the session key in memory to use it to encrypt and decrypt messages sent between the client and server during the current session. Once the session is closed, the session key is discarded and a new one is generated for the next session. The session key is usually only stored in memory and is not saved to disk, so it is typically not persistent across browser restarts or other system changes. This helps ensure that the session key is not accidentally leaked to unauthorized parties.

- So there is no way to get the session key from the browser? Or can we see it?

In general, the session key is not directly visible or accessible to a user or a third party. It is typically stored in the memory of the client device and used to encrypt and decrypt data exchanged between the client and server during the session.

However, it is possible for attackers to intercept and access the session key if they can compromise the security of the client or server. This is why it is important to use secure protocols and encryption algorithms, and to keep software and systems up to date with the latest security patches. Additionally, best practices such as implementing two-factor authentication, restricting access to sensitive data, and regularly monitoring for suspicious activity can help to further protect against attacks.

- So in the above response, a session key is used for only a session, here session means a particular request-response cycle? What is the session here? How long will it last?

Yes, the session key is used for a particular request-response cycle in the SSL/TLS protocol. A session refers to the period of time during which a client and server exchange data over a secure connection. In the SSL/TLS context, a session is typically established when a client connects to a server and performs a handshake to establish a secure connection. The duration of a session can vary depending on the server configuration, but it typically lasts until either the client or server terminates the connection.

In order to optimize performance, SSL/TLS supports session resumption, which allows a client to resume a previously established session without performing a full handshake. This is typically done by caching the session key and other session parameters on the client side and sending them in subsequent requests to the server. The server can then use this information to quickly establish a new session without going through the full handshake process again. The duration of the session cache is configurable on the server side and can be set to expire after a certain amount of time or after a certain number of requests.

- In tls, does the server use the same key par for each client connected or it generates a different public key for each client?

In TLS (Transport Layer Security), the server typically uses the same key pair (i.e., the same private key and corresponding public key) for all clients that connect to it.

Here's how it works: when a client connects to a server over TLS, the server sends its public key to the client as part of the TLS handshake. The client then uses the server's public key to encrypt a random session key, which is used for symmetric encryption during the TLS session. This process is known as "key exchange" and is usually based on asymmetric cryptography.

The server's public key is typically included in its digital certificate, which is signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA) and provides a way for clients to verify the server's identity. The server's private key is kept secret and is used to decrypt the session key encrypted by the client.

Because the server's key pair is used for key exchange, it is the same for all clients that connect to it. However, the session key that is exchanged between the client and server is unique for each TLS session and is generated randomly by the client. This provides a way for each session to use a different key for symmetric encryption, even though the same key pair is used for key exchange.

It's worth noting that there are some TLS extensions, such as the "pre-shared key" (PSK) extension, that allow for different key pairs to be used for different clients. PSK allows the client and server to authenticate each other using a shared secret key, rather than relying on digital certificates. In this case, the server would need to maintain a different PSK for each client that connects to it. However, this is not the standard way that TLS is typically used.


During the TLS handshake, the client and server exchange messages to establish a secure connection. This includes the exchange of public keys (which are used for encryption and decryption) and the generation of shared secrets that will be used to derive session keys for encrypting and decrypting data.

The TLS handshake typically involves the following steps:

The client sends a "hello" message to the server, which includes the highest version of TLS that the client supports and a random number.

The server responds with a "hello" message that includes the version of TLS that will be used for the connection, a random number, and the server's public key certificate.

The client verifies the server's certificate and generates a random pre-master secret, which is encrypted with the server's public key and sent to the server.

The server decrypts the pre-master secret using its private key, and uses it to generate a master secret.

The client and server independently use the master secret, along with the random numbers exchanged earlier, to generate the same session keys.

The client and server exchange "finished" messages to confirm that the handshake was successful, and communication using the session keys can begin.

In step 5, AES is often used as the symmetric encryption algorithm to generate the session keys from the master secret. Specifically, AES in CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode is commonly used to derive the session keys.

Once the session keys are generated, they are used to encrypt and decrypt data transmitted between the client and server, providing strong security for the communication.
